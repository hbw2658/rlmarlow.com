Profile</A>
</H1>
R L Marlow Consulting LLC provides FPGA and USRP design services and expertise. Founded in 2017 by Ryan Marlow. Ryan has worked directly with Ettus Research and a number of their customers. Some examples of work Ryan has done for his clients: wrapped proprietary ip cores into the RFNoC framework to run on a USRP device, developed custom RFNoC blocks that meet customers' needs, devised multi-USRP schemes, using UHD, to have multiple devices work in parallel for more complex tasks, and much more. Outside of the USRP space, Ryan has worked on more general FPGA projects and even custom EDA tools for FPGA that has given him a deep understanding of the inner workings of FPGA.

<LI>FPGA design expertise and commercializing research originated from CCM lab at Virginia Tech. The primary purpose of the company was to develop a product that would speed up and abstract the FPGA compilation process.  Eventually, the company pivoted to consulting work with Ettus Research in support of USRP and RFNoC development.
